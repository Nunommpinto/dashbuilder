## Introduction

Dashbuilder is a web app written in Java which allows non-technical users to visually create business dashboards. It was made to be customizable so that users can shape it the way they want it.


## Requirements

### System Requirements

Dashbuilder requires a Unix base system(e.g. a Linux distribution or a Machintosh) or in case of Windows it requires a [Linux Bash Shell](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).
It also needs Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 (or more recent version), [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) version 3.2.5 and [SuperDevMode](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html).


### Elicitation and Analysis

New features can be suggested essentially by everyone, however regular contributors are more influential. The suggestions and discussions of these features take place mostly in the [dashbuilder's IRC server](http://dashbuilder.org/help/chat.html) and in the [discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dashbuilder-development), which later are merged upstream through the use of pull requests.


### Specification

Dashbuilder has a SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document and a user manual. [Here](http://dashbuilder.org/learn/documentation.html) you can find more about the dashbuilder, its features and the system requirements.
[Other documents](http://dashbuilder.org/learn/slides.html) are also available which provide a high-level overview of Dashbuilder's functional and [technical capabilities](http://dashbuilder.org/learn/screenshots.html).


### Validation

Besides there are planned upcoming features, the release schedule isn't very strict. Contributors can suggest new features which can prevail to the preview upcoming features, eventhough it is not easy to achieve. Those features are subject to a Beta version before the final release.
