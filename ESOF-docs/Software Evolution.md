## Introduction

As new requirements are laid upon the existing software there is the need for the product to evolve and respond to remain useful . As software products can be extensively complex , this evolution can be extremely expensive and very difficult, so there are specific processes to make it happen with ease. As a closure to our semester research our group was assigned to identify a part of this open-source project and develop/create it.

## Feature

### Feature Identification


### Feature Implementation


### Pull requesting


##	Conclusion

The whole experience of reverse engineering an open-source project was very enlightening on what may possibly be our future in the IT market. Dealing with poorly documented projects, unreadable code, and projects that are bottlenecked at its conception, might very well be our daily basis. The concepts we learned and acquired while going through this project are very important and this was a great experience to understand their reach.
