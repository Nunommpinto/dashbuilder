## Introduction

Software architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements of a software system.
It is usually represented using a set of views or perspectives in which the system's components are shown as well as its relationships to each other and the environment.

We will use the **4 + 1 view model** in order to describe Dashbuilder's architecture.
