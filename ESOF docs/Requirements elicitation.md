## Introduction

Dashbuilder is a web app written in Java which allows non-technical users to visually create business dashboards. It was made to be customizable so that users can shape it the way they want it.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

Dashbuilder requires a Unix base system(e.g. a Linux distribution or a Machintosh) or in case of Windows it requires a [Linux Bash Shell](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).
It also needs Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 (or more recent version), [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) version 3.2.5 and [SuperDevMode](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html).

### Elicitation and Analysis

New features can be suggested essentially by everyone, however regular contributors are more influential. The suggestions and discussions of these features take place mostly in the [dashbuilder's IRC server](http://dashbuilder.org/help/chat.html) and in the [discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dashbuilder-development), which later are merged upstream through the use of pull requests.
