## What is Dashbuilder?

## Development Process

### Methodologies
<br>
Seeing as we were not able to contact the team behind this project, we have no official source as to the exact software process that was used.<br>
Starting from the fact that it is an open source project with 17 contribuitors, with only 10 of them being part of the official team, it is fairly easy to assume they took a very incremental development aproach. A big, voluntary team is not very easy to coordinate and therefore the incremental aproach provides the most benefits.<br>
<br>
Even the obvious drawbacks of incremental development, such as the constant need for code refactoring, should be overlooked. Yes, it is one of the simplest methodologies but its simplicity is also a strength. It doesn't fixate what the next step should be at all times, nor does it overwhelm and scare away potencial contribuitors, it lowers the skill ceiling.<br>
<br>
It also allows two or more distinct features to be implemented at a time and this type of flexibility further improves the case in defense of the incremental development methodology because it does not pose a limit on the number of features being added, because even though it is incremental, it is not necessarily successive.<br>
